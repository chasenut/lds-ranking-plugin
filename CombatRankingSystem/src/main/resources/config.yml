# If something is not working, make sure you have installed PlaceholderAPI,
# For some placeholders (like balance top players) you may need to have Essentials (economy) and Vault

# Kill message:
# Placeholders for kill message:
# {killer} - the player who killed (player who killed, is behind the murder) (nickname)
# {player} - the player who got killed (victim, died) (nickname)
# {killer_diff} - amount of points the {killer} got (unsigned int, non-negative)
# {player_diff} - amount of points the {player} lost (unsigned int, non-negative) (same as {killer_diff})
kill-message: '  &#F2C6DE🗡 &fGracz &#F2C6DE{killer} &7(+{killer_diff}) &fzabił gracza &#F2C6DE{player} &7(-{player_diff})'
# Should the message appear in the chat
kill-message-enabled: true

# Rating / ranking / score / points is a INTEGER value (no decimal points, it is being rounded down (truncated))
# Initial combat rating (score) when a player joins the server for the first time
initial-combat-rating: 1000

# Combat score modifier when player kills or gets killed in percent (0.0 means 0%, 1.0 means 100%)
# Adding % of killed player rating to killer's rating and removing (%) from the killed player
# example with 5%: PlayerA (rating of 1000) killed PlayerB (rating of 500),
# PlayerA gains 25 score points (5% of 500) and PlayerB loses 25 score points (5% of 500)
# Result: PlayerA = 1025, PlayerB = 475
combat-score-modifier: 0.05

# Time between data.yml saves and leaderboard updates (seconds)

    # Chat rating prefix (when player sends message)
    # It is shown before message, player display name and rank (very start of the message)
    # Use placeholder {rating} to set the rating value
    enabled: true
    # Remember, if you want to have space between rating and nickname/rank, add space at the end
    # like in the default configuration
    prefix: '&7[{rating}] '

# Some settings of commands output
commands:
  # Remember, the color it 'ends with' will be the color of the command output (you don't want it to be white, so
  # better leave it as it is)
  # These command outputs will most likely be visible to admins only
